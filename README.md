# Total
### Tool for Fun in Trials.
__WARNING__: I am __not__ promoting illegal foul play software. My only goal is to learn the workings of the game and the engine in general. If you are using the tool for malicious purposes, then __stop__. There are no leaderboards or competitive moments in the game. Use and modify the tool if you also want to __learn__ the structure of the game inside and out or learn something else.

# Usage

* Clone Repository: __https://github.com/ShyKiss/Total.git__
* Open and Compile __Total.sln__ with VS2022
* Update SDK (optionally, if game is updated but repository is not)

# How to update SDK?

* Use [__Dumper-7__](https://github.com/Encryqed/Dumper-7?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-use)
* Drop contents of `[Dumper-7 generated path]/CppSDK` folder into `Total/src/SDK`
